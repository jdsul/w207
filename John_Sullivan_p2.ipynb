    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup postings on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish between the topics based on the text of the posts. Whereas with digit classification, the input is relatively dense: a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero, here we'll represent each document with a \"bag-of-words\" model. As you'll see, this makes the feature representation quite sparse -- only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The bag-of-words assumption here is that the label depends only on the words; their order is not important.\n",

    "ANSWER: \n",
    "\n",
    "a) There are two things that are true of posts which cause k nearest neighbors to struggle. The first is that there are a lot of different words being used, even among posts in the same category, so each category isn't necessarily very similar internally and individual posts may be similar to those in other classes. The second problem is that there's a lot of words in each post that tell you nothing about what category it should be in (a, the, in, by etc.) which just serve to add a lot of noise. To the model two posts with \"the\" in them 15 times are as similar as two posts with \"Jesus\" in them 15 times, even though those two words in reality tell you vastly different amounts of information about the type of post.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) I would guess that Naive Bayes works better than logistic regression here because there are some words which are correlated with both a single classification and with certain other words. In Naive Bayes both these inputs will be weighted strongly, even if they're correlated with each other, while logistic regression will give them lower weights due to their collinearity. This is fine if both words appear in a document but if only one of the words appears in a document then the higher weight in naive Bayes will result in the document being more likely to be classified properly than the lower weight logistic regression would assign.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) The C term specifies how sensitive the regression is to outliers in the training data. A lower value for C will allow the regression more flexibility in fitting itself to the random variations in the training data, while a higher value of C will restrict the models ability to fit random variations, particularly when there is a small amount of training data. So C and the sum of squared weights have a positive relationship because the higher C is the more the less variance it is able to account for, which means more variance will go unexplained, increasing the sum of squared weights."

    "ANSWER: I find it surprising that in most cases the weights on the top bigram features are much lower than the weights on the top single word features. For both graphics and atheism the lowest weighted of the top 5 single word features is weighted more than the most strongly weighted bigram feature. There is some overlap in weights of the top 5 on the religion and space categories but in both cases the top weight and the bottom weight in the single word top 5 are higher than their corresponding weights in the bigram top 5.

    "(5) Try to improve the logistic regression classifier by passing a custom preprocessor to CountVectorizer. The preprocessing function runs on the raw text, before it is split into words by the tokenizer. Your preprocessor should try to normalize the input in various ways to improve generalization. For example, try lowercasing everything, replacing sequences of numbers with a single token, removing various other non-letter characters, and shortening long words. If you're not already familiar with regular expressions for manipulating strings, see https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html, and re.sub() in particular. With your new preprocessor, how much did you reduce the size of the dictionary?\n",

    "(6) The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. That is, logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small size. The default regularization, L2, computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (see P3, above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. The result is that whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives lots of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Train a logistic regression model using a \"l1\" penalty. Output the number of learned weights that are not equal to zero. How does this compare to the number of non-zero weights you get with \"l2\"? Now, reduce the size of the vocabulary by keeping only those features that have at least one non-zero weight and retrain a model using \"l2\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Make a plot showing accuracy of the re-trained model vs. the vocabulary size you get when pruning unused features by adjusting the C parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The gradient descent code that trains the logistic regression model sometimes has trouble converging with extreme settings of the C parameter. Relax the convergence criteria by setting tol=.01 (the default is .0001)."

    "ANSWER: The two highest R values are both religion posts that were miscategorized as graphics posts. Both are documents about ways to download the Book of Mormon so they contain some technical computer terms that are presumably relatively common in the graphics posts but very rare in religion posts (and likely rare in posts in the other two categories as well). The third most incorrect post was a single sentence post that was predicted to be religion but was actually atheism. The post is generic enough that I think a human guessing the answer would have a change little better than 50/50 of getting it right between those two categories.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of correction my first thought is that some words, like Mormon, should be hardcoded with very high weights so if they appear several times they'd almost guarantee that the post is categorized in a certain category. But artificial weights would more or less defeat the purpose of the model and would still struggle with classifying posts like the top two because they contain terms that strongly indicate both correct and incorrect classes. In this case I would bet that this problem is exacerbated by the available categories because there are probably many terms that appear often in both the religion and atheism class so their weights would be lowered for each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, bigrams and trigrams could help for these specific examples because the technical terms are unlikely to appear around other words consistently while \"Book of Mormon\" is much more likely to appear together and consequently have a high weight."
